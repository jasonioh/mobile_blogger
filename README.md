This is a [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) script that integrates with the iOS share panel to allow you to:
* use your favorite iOS markdown editor to create Jekyll posts
* automatically create the YAML front-matter for these posts using the post's main header and text input
* automatically commit these files to a [Gitlab](https://gitlab) repo (yes, Gitlabâ€”I don't use the Jekyll integration with Github)
* automatically sync these files to a designated location in Dropbox

The config file let's you specify Gitlab and Dropbox deets.

This is largely based on the [work](http://codenugget.co/2015/11/18/mobile-blogging-with-pythonista-jekyll-and-github.html) from Pascal Cremer, but updated for Gitlab (vs Github) and with the added integration with Dropbox.
